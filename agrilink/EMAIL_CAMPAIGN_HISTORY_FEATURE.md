## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Saving**
When you send an email campaign:

1. **Campaign is sent** to all subscribers
2. **Results are tracked** (success/failure counts)
3. **Campaign is automatically saved** to database with:
   - Subject and message content
   - Timestamp of when it was sent
   - Number of successful deliveries
   - List of recipient email addresses
   - Campaign status and error count
   - Who sent it (Admin Dashboard)

### **Database Schema**
New `EmailCampaign` collection stores:
```javascript
{
  subject: "Campaign subject line",
  message: "Full campaign message",
  sentAt: "2025-07-04T10:30:00Z",
  sentToCount: 150,
  sentBy: "Admin Dashboard",
  recipientEmails: ["user1@email.com", "user2@email.com"],
  status: "sent", // or "failed" or "partial"
  errorCount: 0,
  campaignType: "manual" // or "automated"
}
```
