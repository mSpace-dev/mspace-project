# 🎯 **IMPORTANT: Project Structure Clarification**

## ✅ **Correct Setup - Use AgriLink Project Only**

You are absolutely correct! You should **NOT** run the separate admin folder. Here's the proper setup:

### 📁 **Project Structure**
```
mspace-project/
├── agrilink/          ← **USE THIS PROJECT** ✅
│   ├── src/app/admin/ ← Admin functionality here
│   └── ...
├── admin/             ← **IGNORE THIS FOLDER** ❌
└── pricefetch/
```

### 🚀 **How to Run**

**ONLY run the AgriLink project:**
```bash
cd agrilink
npm run dev
```

**Access URLs:**
- **Main AgriLink**: http://localhost:3002/
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:3002/admin
- **Email Campaign**: http://localhost:3002/admin/email-campaign

### 🔗 **Integrated Features in AgriLink**

✅ **Email Campaign**: Built into `/admin/email-campaign`
✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Available at `/admin`
✅ **All Dependencies**: Already in AgriLink's package.json
✅ **Email Service**: Integrated with existing emailService.ts
✅ **Database**: Uses same MongoDB connection
✅ **Authentication**: Uses existing admin auth system

### 📝 **What I Added to AgriLink**

1. **New Admin Page**: `/admin/email-campaign`
2. **API Routes**: 
   - `/api/email/send-campaign`
   - `/api/email/stats`
3. **Email Functions**: Added to existing emailService.ts
4. **UI Integration**: Added email campaign section to admin dashboard

### 🗑️ **What to Ignore**

The separate `admin/` folder was created by mistake. You can safely ignore or delete it. Everything you need is now integrated into the main AgriLink project.

### 🎉 **Benefits of Integration**

- ✅ Single project to maintain
- ✅ Shared dependencies and configuration
- ✅ Unified authentication system
- ✅ Same database and email service
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX across the platform
- ✅ Easier deployment and maintenance

**You were absolutely right to question the separate admin folder!** The integrated approach is much better and more practical.
